# Message Taxonomy

Most (all?) software can be modeled with messages being passed between components. Whether the components are classes, functions, services or whole systems, message-passing is fundamental. These messages have a variety of _types_ - and _subtypes_ - which have different properties, invariants, advantages, and disadvantages. Broadly, we can categorise these messages into Queries, Commands, and Events.

## Queries

## Commands
